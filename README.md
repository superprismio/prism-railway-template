# Prism Railway Template

Railway template source for a Codex-first community agent platform:

- `services/site` for the public/admin web app and app API
- `services/prism-memory` for the Prism memory API
- `services/source-adapter` for source-specific ingestion into Prism memory
- `services/prism-trigger` for one-shot cron/ops triggers

Current direction:

- Codex CLI is the primary agent/operator runtime
- `discord-adapter` is the supported Discord bridge for sync plus live chat transport
- `codex-runtime` is the shared Codex CLI runtime for Discord and future adapters
- `site` owns the app API and SQLite-backed runtime state
- `codex-runtime` and `discord-adapter` call `site` over the internal network

This repo is intentionally split by deployable service instead of using PM2 inside one container.

The current folders reflect the work in progress, not the final target shape.

- Railway service: `site`
- Railway service: `prism-memory`
- Railway service: `discord-adapter`
- Railway service: `codex-runtime`
- Railway service: `discord-sync-cron`
- Railway service: `memory-cron`
- Railway service: `knowledge-cron`

Recommended deployment model:

1. Import this repo into Railway as a JavaScript monorepo.
2. Create one service per deployable directory.
3. Point each service at its own root directory under `services/`.
4. Keep `prism-memory` on a persistent volume.
5. Use `services/prism-trigger` twice for the cron jobs with different env vars.
6. Route operator chat through the Discord-to-Codex bridge.
7. Mount the app SQLite/data volume on `site` at `/data`.

## Service Map

### `services/site`

Owns:

- public/admin routes
- auth and sessions
- profiles, points, badges, and admin flows
- change requests, executions, targets, and deploy metadata as the system of record
- agent chat sessions and Discord thread linkage as durable conversation state
- the internal app API surface consumed by Codex runtime and Discord
- the app SQLite/runtime volume at `/data`

### `services/prism-memory`

Owns:

- normalized message ingest
- the vendored `prism-memory-starter` runtime under `prism_seed/default`, seeded into the configured runtime space
- memory, knowledge, and product retrieval API
- mounted data volume at `/data/prism_seed/<PRISM_API_SPACE>`
- authenticated `/ops/*` routes for collect, digest, memory, seeds, and knowledge jobs

### `services/source-adapter`

Owns:

- source-specific authentication and collection
- source-specific normalization for Discord, Slack, or Telegram
- posting normalized batches into `prism-memory`

### `services/codex-runtime`

Owns:

- Codex CLI-backed chat execution via HTTP
- persisted Codex auth and thread state through `CODEX_HOME`
- reusable runtime endpoint for Discord, Slack, and the admin console

Does not own:

- durable request state
- execution history as the source of truth
- deploy metadata
- Discord transport concerns
- durable app-side chat session storage

Current scaffold:

- `GET /health` for Railway health checks
- `GET /codex/health`
- `POST /v1/responses`

Target direction:

- adapters call one shared Codex runtime instead of embedding it
- persisted Codex thread IDs are mapped to app-side sessions
- Prism Memory is available as optional runtime context, not forced on every turn

### `services/source-adapter`

Owns:

- source-specific authentication and collection
- source-specific normalization for Discord, Slack, or Telegram
- posting normalized batches into `prism-memory`
- Discord mention/thread chat transport that forwards to `codex-runtime`

### `services/prism-trigger`

Owns:

- one-shot authenticated trigger call into Prism memory

Use two Railway services from this one directory:

- `memory-cron` with `PRISM_TRIGGER_PATH=/ops/memory/run`
- `knowledge-cron` with `PRISM_TRIGGER_PATH=/ops/knowledge/run`

Optionally add a third cron service from the same directory:

- `discord-sync-cron` with `PRISM_API_BASE=https://your-discord-adapter.up.railway.app`
- `discord-sync-cron` with `PRISM_TRIGGER_PATH=/sync`
- `discord-sync-cron` with `PRISM_TRIGGER_AUTH_HEADER=X-Adapter-Token`
- `discord-sync-cron` with `PRISM_TRIGGER_AUTH_TOKEN=<SOURCE_ADAPTER_TOKEN>`

## Local Setup

This scaffold is intentionally light. It gives you a deploy shape and starter services, not a full migration of the existing app.

```bash
npm run bootstrap
```

That will:

- create `.env` from `.env.example` if needed
- install all npm workspaces
- create `services/prism-memory/.venv`
- install the Prism memory Python dependencies
- install the source adapter TypeScript workspace dependencies

Default local ports:

- Site: `3100`
- Source adapter: `8789`
- Prism memory: `8788`

Then work service-by-service:

```bash
npm run dev --workspace @prism-railway/site
```

Or run the whole local stack:

```bash
npm run dev:all
```

For local development, use concrete loopback URLs in `.env`; Railway template references such as `${{api.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}` only resolve inside Railway templates.

Minimum local values:

```text
API_INTERNAL_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3100
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3100
APP_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3100
CODEX_RUNTIME_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3030
PRISM_API_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8788
PRISM_API_KEY=replace-me
INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN=replace-me
SOURCE_ADAPTER_TOKEN=replace-me
OUTPUT_ADAPTER_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8789
OUTPUT_ADAPTER_TOKEN=replace-me
```

Codex runtime needs local Codex auth. The default `.env.example` uses your normal `~/.codex`:

```text
CODEX_HOME=$HOME/.codex
```

Discord and voice transcription are optional locally. Leave these blank unless you want to test Discord sync/chat or `/prism-record`:

```text
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=
VOICE_TRANSCRIPTION_BASE_URL=
VOICE_TRANSCRIPTION_API_KEY=
```

### Local Target Apps

Shared target bootstrap data should only include stable shared environments such as staging and production.

Do not commit machine-specific local target values such as:

- local filesystem paths
- local app ports
- local dev commands

For example, if you want to work against a local target app checkout, start that app in its own repo and keep the path and port as operator-local knowledge rather than baking them into `services/site/config/target-apps.default.json`.

Current local example:

- repo: `../example-target-app`
- app URL: `http://localhost:5173/`
- start command:

```bash
cd ../example-target-app
nvm use
npm install
npm run dev
```

If the Prism app needs to reference a local target during development, create that target record manually in the local admin/API layer instead of committing it to the shared manifest.

## Railway Notes

- Each service directory includes its own `railway.json`.
- Do not use one repo-level `startCommand` for every service.
- Set service-specific env vars in Railway, not in source control.
- `services/source-adapter` is the preferred place for Discord/Slack/Telegram collection for memory ingest.
- `services/source-adapter` supports persisted sync checkpoints, `dry_run`, and resettable sync windows.
- `services/prism-memory` seeds the starter runtime into its mounted volume and keeps the active config at `/data/prism_seed/<PRISM_API_SPACE>/config/space.json`.
- `prism-memory` and `source-adapter` both use explicit Dockerfiles so the deploy runtime stays pinned and reproducible.

## Deployment Checklist

For a first Railway bring-up:

1. Create services for `site`, `prism-memory`, `discord-adapter`, `codex-runtime`, `discord-sync-cron`, `memory-cron`, and `knowledge-cron`.
2. Set each service root directory to its matching folder under `services/`.
3. Deploy `site`, then run `migrate`, `bootstrap:admin`, and `bootstrap:targets`.
4. For `prism-memory`, mount a persistent volume for runtime state.
5. Configure `discord-adapter` to post normalized batches into `prism-memory` and persist checkpoints on its service volume or data root.
6. Configure `discord-sync-cron` to call `discord-adapter /sync` with `X-Adapter-Token`.
7. Deploy `codex-runtime` with persistent `CODEX_HOME` storage and complete `codex login` once in the running service.
8. Deploy `discord-adapter` with Discord bot credentials, app API base URL, internal service token, and `CODEX_RUNTIME_BASE_URL`.
9. Set shared URLs so `codex-runtime` and `discord-adapter` point to `site`, and services point to `prism-memory` where needed.
10. Set secrets in Railway, especially `SESSION_SECRET`, `INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `PRISM_API_KEY`, `SOURCE_ADAPTER_TOKEN`, `OUTPUT_ADAPTER_TOKEN`, and Codex/Discord credentials.
10. Deploy `site` and confirm `/admin` loads.

API bootstrap split:

- `npm run migrate --workspace @prism-railway/api`
- `npm run bootstrap:admin --workspace @prism-railway/api`
- `npm run bootstrap:targets --workspace @prism-railway/api`
- optional: `npm run seed:catalog --workspace @prism-railway/api`
- optional: `npm run seed:demo --workspace @prism-railway/api`

Remote Railway API bootstrap from your local terminal:

```bash
npm run railway:bootstrap-api -- \
  --environment production \
  --service api
```

Combined deploy and bootstrap flow:

```bash
npm run railway:deploy-prism-stack -- \
  --prism-api-base https://prism-memory-production.up.railway.app \
  --prism-api-key <PRISM_API_KEY> \
  --run-memory \
  --run-knowledge
```

This will:

- deploy `api`
- run `migrate`, `bootstrap:admin`, and `bootstrap:targets` on `api`
- deploy `site`
- deploy `prism-memory`
- optionally trigger `memory.run` and `knowledge.run`

Manual steps still required:

- Codex auth/bootstrap for the chosen runtime
- Discord bridge onboarding
- Railway secret entry
- Railway cron schedule setup. Template instances may create `memory-cron`, `knowledge-cron`, and `discord-sync-cron` without recurring schedules; add schedules manually after deploy. Suggested starting points: hourly `memory-cron`, daily `knowledge-cron`, and 15-60 minute `discord-sync-cron` only after Discord is configured.

## Suggested Migration Order

1. Move the API contract first.
2. Point the site at the new API.
3. Move Prism memory with a volume and normalized ingest.
4. Add a source adapter for Discord collection if memory ingestion needs channel history.
5. Add the Discord-to-Codex bridge.
6. Decide whether to flatten `site` and `api` into one Next.js app.
7. Add cron triggers last.
