description: Read from the Prism Memory API using a read-scoped API key. Use when an agent needs rolling memory, digests, participant activity, knowledge search, knowledge docs, memory/knowledge artifacts such as meeting summaries, or product suggestion outputs without writing to inboxes or triggering ops endpoints.

# Prism API Reader

Use this skill for read-scoped retrieval against the deployed Prism Memory API.

This is the agent-facing retrieval layer. Keep it focused on how to query current Prism state. Do not duplicate storage logic, indexing logic, or pipeline rules here.

## Required auth

Send:

```text
X-Prism-Api-Key: <read-key>
```

Use a read-scoped key only.

## Base workflow

1. Start from the narrowest endpoint that can answer the question.
2. For knowledge questions, search first, then fetch specific docs.
3. For recent community activity, prefer digests and participant queries over scanning raw memory.
4. For meeting summaries, transcripts, or linked artifact IDs, fetch the artifact detail directly before broader search.
5. Cite the exact docs, artifact IDs, dates, buckets, and endpoints used.

## Endpoint selection

- Latest memory snapshot:
  `GET /memory/latest`
- Memory for a day:
  `GET /memory/date/{yyyy-mm-dd}`
- Digest for a day:
  `GET /digests/date/{yyyy-mm-dd}`
- Digest for one bucket/day:
  `GET /digests/bucket/{bucket}/date/{yyyy-mm-dd}`
- Active participants in a time window:
  `GET /memory/participants?start=...&end=...&bucket=...`
- Latest project state:
  `GET /state/latest`
- Knowledge manifest:
  `GET /knowledge/indexes/manifest`
- Knowledge sources:
  `GET /knowledge/sources`
- Knowledge source detail:
  `GET /knowledge/sources/{source-id}`
- Knowledge search:
  `GET /knowledge/search?q=...&kind=...&tag=...&entity=...&limit=...`
- Knowledge doc:
  `GET /knowledge/docs/{slug}`
- Human-readable knowledge doc:
  `GET /knowledge/view/{slug}`
- Artifact list:
  `GET /api/artifacts?category=...&type=...&source=...&status=...&limit=...`
- Artifact detail:
  `GET /api/artifacts/{artifact-id}`
- Raw artifact:
  `GET /api/artifacts/{artifact-id}/raw`
- Product suggestions:
  `GET /products/suggestions/latest`
  `GET /products/suggestions/date/{yyyy-mm-dd}`
  `GET /products/suggestions/weekly/{yyyy-WW}`

## Retrieval rules

- For knowledge:
  - use `/knowledge/search` first
  - then fetch top matches with `/knowledge/docs/{slug}`
  - when replying with citations, prefer the Prism `doc_url` returned by search/doc responses
  - in chat-style answers, do not leave “Relevant docs” as raw slugs or endpoint paths when a Prism `doc_url` is available
  - if you list supporting docs, format them as human-viewable Prism links first
  - include `source_url` when it exists and adds value, but Prism doc links are the default
  - prefer `guide` and `policy` docs for workflows
  - prefer `reference` docs for templates
- For repo-backed handbook setup or diagnostics:
  - inspect `/knowledge/sources` before suggesting a new source
  - treat an existing `repo_url + branch` source as the canonical sync target
- For memory:
  - use `/memory/latest` for compact current state
  - use `/memory/date/{date}` for a specific day
  - use `/digests/date/{date}` for bucket-level daily detail
- For participation:
  - use `/memory/participants`
  - report the exact `start` and `end` used
- For project state:
  - use `/state/latest`
  - do not infer active project state from memory alone
- For artifacts:
  - if the user provides a Prism artifact link, use the final path segment as the artifact ID
  - use `/artifacts/{artifact-id}` when the user wants a human-viewable link to share in Discord or chat
  - use `/api/artifacts/{artifact-id}` for structured metadata and content lookup
  - use `/api/artifacts/{artifact-id}/raw` only when the user explicitly wants the raw payload
  - use `/api/artifacts?source=discord-voice&type=meeting_summary&limit=...` for recent voice summaries
  - do not present `/api/artifacts/{artifact-id}` as the primary human-facing link
  - do not invent alternate raw paths; the raw route is exactly `/api/artifacts/{artifact-id}/raw`
  - when giving a link back to the user, prefer the full absolute Prism URL when the base is known

## Safety

- Treat the Prism Memory API as the source of truth for current deployed state.
- If a route returns empty or `404`, say so directly.
- Do not call write or ops endpoints from this skill.
- Do not guess Prism routes from memory when the API contract already defines them.
