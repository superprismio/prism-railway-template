# Prism API Ops

Use this skill only with an ops-capable Prism Memory API key and explicit authorization.

This skill triggers existing pipeline operations through the API. It does not reimplement the pipeline inside the agent runtime.

## Required auth

Send:

```text
X-Prism-Api-Key: <ops-key>
```

## Ops endpoints

- Memory run:
  `POST /ops/memory/run`
- Memory backfill:
  `POST /ops/memory/backfill?days=30&force=true`
- State rebuild:
  `POST /ops/state/run?date=YYYY-MM-DD&force=true`
- State backfill:
  `POST /ops/state/backfill?days=60&force=true`
- Knowledge promote only:
  `POST /ops/knowledge/promote`
- Knowledge validate only:
  `POST /ops/knowledge/validate`
- Knowledge index only:
  `POST /ops/knowledge/index`
- Knowledge full run:
  `POST /ops/knowledge/run`

## Usage rules

- Use `memory.run` for normal collection, digest, memory, and seed processing.
- Use `memory.backfill` only when explicitly asked to recompute historical windows.
- Use `state.run` to rebuild generated project/objective/signal/throughline state for one day without running digest, memory, or seeds.
- Use `state.backfill` to rebuild generated state over recent history without deleting raw records.
- Use `knowledge.run` after writing new knowledge inbox docs that should become searchable now.
- Prefer the narrowest endpoint that solves the task.

## Safety

- Do not run backfills casually.
- State the exact date or day range before triggering historical recomputation.
- Report the returned `operation`, `exit_code`, and any `stdout` summary.
- If an ops endpoint fails, surface the returned error body directly instead of paraphrasing loosely.
