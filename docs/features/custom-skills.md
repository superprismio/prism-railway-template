# Custom Skills

Prism skills are file-shaped instructions that Codex can load when a prompt or task requests them.

## Source Layout

- Template built-ins live in `services/site/skills/*`.
- Instance custom skills live in `/data/skills/*/SKILL.md` on the `site` service volume.
- Prism Memory built-ins may still be exposed by `prism-memory` for memory-specific operations.
- Executable helper scripts, checkpoints, and generated outputs should not live inside skill folders. Put those under an instance path such as `/data/custom/<workflow>/...` on the service that runs them.

For example, the RaidGuild DAO proposal experiment uses:

- Skill definition: `/data/skills/dao-proposal-watcher/SKILL.md`
- Runtime script: `/data/custom/dao-proposals/scripts/dao_proposal_watcher.mjs`
- Runtime state/output: `/data/custom/dao-proposals/checkpoint.json` and `/data/custom/dao-proposals/proposals/*.md`

## Ownership

`site` is the custom skill manager. `codex-runtime` is the executor.

Codex should create or update custom skill definitions through the site internal API:

```bash
curl -fsSL \
  -X POST \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "x-service-token: $PRISM_AGENT_SERVICE_TOKEN" \
  "$PRISM_AGENT_API_BASE_URL/agent/skills" \
  -d @skill-payload.json
```

Payload:

```json
{
  "name": "example-skill",
  "content": "---\nname: example-skill\ndescription: Use this skill when...\n---\n\nSkill instructions go here.\n"
}
```

The skill then appears in the admin Skills tab and is available through the same site-hosted skill download flow used by `codex-runtime`.

Custom skills can be removed by name through the same internal API:

```bash
curl -fsSL \
  -X DELETE \
  -H "x-service-token: $PRISM_AGENT_SERVICE_TOKEN" \
  "$PRISM_AGENT_API_BASE_URL/agent/skills/example-skill"
```

Only custom skills under `/data/skills` can be deleted this way. Template built-ins return `409`.

## Registry Decision

There is no DB registry yet. For now, the canonical custom skill source is the `SKILL.md` file under `/data/skills`.

A DB registry becomes useful when Prism needs state that does not belong in `SKILL.md`, such as:

- enabled/disabled status
- owner/reviewer
- version/hash history
- review or approval status
- task references
- archive/delete history

Until then, file discovery keeps skills close to Codex's native format and avoids two sources of truth.
