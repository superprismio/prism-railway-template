# Local And VPS Deployment

This stack is designed for Railway templates, but it is not Railway-only.

You can run it:

- locally for development
- on a VPS with `systemd`, Docker Compose, or another process manager
- on Railway with the existing template flow

The main difference outside Railway is that you must provide:

- concrete service URLs instead of Railway service references
- persistent storage paths
- your own cron scheduling
- your own reverse proxy and TLS where needed

## What Is Railway-Specific vs Portable

Portable parts:

- `site`
- `codex-runtime`
- `prism-memory`
- `discord-adapter`
- `prism-trigger`

Railway-specific conveniences:

- internal DNS such as `RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN`
- public service domains such as `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`
- mounted volumes at `/data`
- built-in cron schedules

Those Railway features are conveniences, not hard requirements.

## Local Development

### One-command local instance

The Compose-backed local instance keeps the Prism control plane in containers
and runs Codex Runtime as a host-native runtime adapter so it can use the
operator's existing Codex authentication and local repositories.

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 20 or newer
- Docker with the Compose plugin
- repository dependencies installed with `npm install`
- Codex CLI installed and authenticated

Initialize and start:

```bash
npm run local:init
npm run local:up
```

The first command prints the generated local admin credentials once. Internal
service tokens and encryption keys are written with restrictive permissions
under `~/.local/share/prism/instances/default`. Provider credentials are not
stored there; add them through **Settings > Gateway** after login.

Common lifecycle commands:

```bash
npm run local:status
npm run local:doctor
npm run local:logs
npm run local:down
```

Set `PRISM_LOCAL_INSTANCE` to operate more than one named local instance, or
`PRISM_LOCAL_HOME` to move local instance data. The Compose services bind to
loopback by default.

### Contributor development

Use the repo bootstrap first:

```bash
npm run bootstrap
```

Then copy or adjust `.env` from `.env.example`.

For local development, use loopback URLs and your normal Codex home:

```env
API_INTERNAL_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3100
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3100
APP_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3100
CODEX_RUNTIME_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3030
PRISM_API_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8788
PRISM_API_KEY=replace-me
INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN=replace-me
SOURCE_ADAPTER_TOKEN=replace-me
CODEX_HOME=$HOME/.codex
```

For local Codex runtime, `CODEX_HOME` should point to your normal Codex home:

```env
CODEX_HOME=$HOME/.codex
```

Do not set local `CODEX_HOME` to Railway-style `/data/codex` unless you intentionally want a separate local auth state.

Default local ports:

- `site`: `3100`
- `codex-runtime`: `3030`
- `prism-memory`: `8788`
- `discord-adapter`: `8789`
- `task-runner`: `8790`
- `prism-gateway`: `8794`

Run the whole stack:

```bash
npm run dev:all
```

Or run services individually:

```bash
npm run dev --workspace @prism-railway/site
CODEX_HOME="$HOME/.codex" PORT=3030 npm run dev --workspace @prism-railway/codex-runtime
PORT=8789 npm run dev --workspace @prism-railway/source-adapter
```

For `prism-memory`, use its virtualenv and local server flow from `services/prism-memory`.

## VPS Deployment

On a VPS, the stack works the same way, but you need to supply the operational pieces Railway normally gives you.

Minimum requirements:

- Node.js for the JS services
- Python plus the Prism Memory venv for `prism-memory`
- `git` for `codex-runtime` and knowledge source sync
- `ffmpeg` for Discord voice transcription flow
- a reverse proxy such as Nginx or Caddy
- persistent disk for service data
- cron or timers for recurring jobs

Recommended persistent paths:

- `site`: `/srv/prism/site-data`
- `codex-runtime`: `/srv/prism/codex`
- `codex-runtime` workspaces: `/srv/prism/workspaces`
- `prism-memory`: `/srv/prism/prism-memory`
- `discord-adapter`: `/srv/prism/discord-adapter`

Example VPS env values:

```env
API_INTERNAL_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3100
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://app.example.com
APP_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3100
CODEX_RUNTIME_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3030
PRISM_API_BASE=https://memory.example.com
PRISM_API_KEY=replace-me
INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN=replace-me
SOURCE_ADAPTER_TOKEN=replace-me

CODEX_HOME=/srv/prism/codex
CODEX_TARGET_WORKSPACE_ROOT=/srv/prism/workspaces
PRISM_AGENT_DATA_ROOT=/srv/prism/site-data
PRISM_API_DATA_ROOT=/srv/prism/prism-memory
SOURCE_ADAPTER_DATA_ROOT=/srv/prism/discord-adapter
```

If you want local-only access between services on the VPS, keep the service-to-service URLs on `127.0.0.1` and only expose the public routes you actually need.

## Public vs Private Services

Typical public routes:

- `site`
- `prism-memory` if you want human-shareable artifact and knowledge links
- `discord-adapter` if Discord or external webhook callbacks need public reachability

Typical private-only routes:

- `codex-runtime`
- cron trigger services

## Persistent State

Outside Railway, you still need durable storage for:

- Codex auth and thread state
- target repo workspaces
- Prism Memory data
- Discord recording recovery data

The important runtime paths are:

- `CODEX_HOME`
- `CODEX_TARGET_WORKSPACE_ROOT`
- `PRISM_API_DATA_ROOT`
- `SOURCE_ADAPTER_DATA_ROOT`
- `PRISM_AGENT_DATA_ROOT`

## Cron Jobs

Railway uses separate trigger services. On a VPS you can keep that model or replace it with direct scheduled HTTP calls.

Suggested schedules:

- memory: hourly
- knowledge: daily
- Discord sync: every 15-60 minutes after Discord is configured

Example cron-style calls:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-Prism-Api-Key: $PRISM_API_KEY" \
  "http://127.0.0.1:8788/ops/memory/run"
```

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-Prism-Api-Key: $PRISM_API_KEY" \
  "http://127.0.0.1:8788/ops/knowledge/run"
```

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-Adapter-Token: $SOURCE_ADAPTER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{}" \
  "http://127.0.0.1:8789/sync"
```

## Discord And Voice

Discord is optional outside Railway, just like it is on Railway.

Set these only when you want Discord chat or sync:

```env
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=
DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID=
DISCORD_CHAT_ENABLED=true
DISCORD_REGISTER_COMMANDS=true
```

Voice transcription is also optional:

```env
VOICE_TRANSCRIPTION_BASE_URL=https://api.venice.ai/api/v1/audio/transcriptions
VOICE_TRANSCRIPTION_API_KEY=
VOICE_TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL=nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3
VOICE_DAVE_ENCRYPTION=true
```

## GitHub Access

Public target repos do not require a token for read-side clone/fetch.

Private target repos still require:

```env
TARGET_REPO_GITHUB_TOKEN=
```

That token is mainly for:

- cloning private repos
- pushing CR branches

## Recommended First Smoke Test

For a non-Railway deployment, validate in this order:

1. `api`, `site`, `prism-memory`, and `codex-runtime` health endpoints
2. Codex auth in `CODEX_HOME`
3. target repo branch creation from the CR flow
4. optional Discord mention chat
5. optional voice recording summary and Prism artifact links

## Notes

- Local development should use `CODEX_HOME=$HOME/.codex`.
- Railway deployments should continue to use a persistent mounted path such as `/data/codex`.
- If you want a first-class non-Railway deployment path later, the next useful artifact is a `docker-compose.yml` with explicit bind mounts and reverse proxy notes.
